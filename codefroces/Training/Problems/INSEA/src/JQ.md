Problem A: JQ

Write a subset of the famous jq command line utility.

Given a JSON object, answer a bunch of json-path queries by
outputting either the value at the path or "None"

There is no trick to this problem, basically every "correct"
solution works.

The problem is easy-ish on the solving side, but much harder
to code and debug especially in a contest setting.
